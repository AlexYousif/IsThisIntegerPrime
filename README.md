# IsThisIntegerPrime
This program *implements* a function--viz., "is_Prime," which takes an integer value and returns true if the integer is a prime number, and false otherwise. The implementation of the "is_Prime" function is done in the main function. Furthermore, the assert functions are used as a way of debugging.
